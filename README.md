# Machine Setup

This repo is purely for setting up a Mac OS X Machine in my image as it were.

Feel free to use this repo to install a shedload of applications on your machine too to get you going.

If you want to clone a bunch of git repos when running this script, add a `repos.txt` to your repo after checkout with a line-seperated list of SSH-style git URLS. This will then automatically clone all of them into `~/Code` for you.

Also, you need your name and email as such:

`./setup-machine.sh <name> <email>`

When you run the script, so it can sort your git config out for you.

Enjoy!
